    "### NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "***NumPy*** is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.  It is a library that provides a multidimensional array object, additional derived objects, and a variety of methods and routines for executing fast operations on arrays.  These include mathematical, shape manipulation, searching, logical,  sorting, I/O, statistical, random simulation, and many other operations.  NumPy has many benefits, but some of the key benefits include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Compact storage***: the data structures use less memory per item than a typical python list\n",
    "- ***Fast array loops***: array operations utilize vectorization that is implemented in C for increased speed\n",
    "- ***Slicing without copying***: slicing a NumPy array doesn't create a new object\n",
    "- ***Useful and efficient array operations***: NumPy supports array level operations such as joining, splitting, sorting, filtering, and reducing arrays\n",
    "- ***Compatibility***: NumPy is compatible with many other scientific python libraries such as SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib \n",

    "***SciPy*** is a collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on the NumPy library.  It adds functionality to programs in terms of data-processing to the point that it can rival systems and languages such as IDL, MATLAB, R-Lab, etc.  SciPy has many benefits, but some of the key benefits include:\n",

For example, a vector or 1-D array would be referred to as a *rank 1 tensor* and a matrix or 2-D array would be referred to as a *rank 2 tensor*.  Each dimension or rank in an array/tensor is represented by an *axis*.  When performing operations on NumPy Arrays, "
