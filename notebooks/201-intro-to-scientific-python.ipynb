    "For the purposes of this course, ***scientific python*** will refer to the act or process of using the Python programming language to complete any scientific, engineering, or related task.  There is no specific set of packages that you have to use to do scientific python, but there are some well developed, supported, and popular packages.  In the end, it all comes down to what you feel most comfortable working with to complete your complex scientific tasks. "
