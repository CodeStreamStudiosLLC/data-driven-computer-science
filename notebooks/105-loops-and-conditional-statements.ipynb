    "A ***while loop*** is used to execute a set of statements as long as a specified condition is true. If you wish to terminate a while loop even when the specified condition is true, you can use a *break* statement.  Break statements allow you to override the while loop condition using a secondary condition. *Continue* statements allow you skip iterations in the loop if a certain condition is met.  *Else* statements allow you to run a block of code once the while loop condition is no longer met.  In cases where there is no code/statement within the loop that will cause the loop to terminate, you have a situation where an *infinite loop* is created.  Infinite loops are loops that run indefinitely and cannot be terminated without terminating the program.  In some cases, infinite loops will cause memory issues resulting in program/computer crashes.  "
