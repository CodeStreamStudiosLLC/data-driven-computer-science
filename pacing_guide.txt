For this course, the intro lessons should take about 15-20 minutes maximum.  All other lessons should take 30-45 minutes to complete.  The projects for Unit 1 and 2 should take less than an hour.  The project for Unit 3 may take anywhere from an hour to 2 hours depending on how long it takes for the students to determine how they want to represent the variables using marker features.  The Unit 4 project should take no longer than 2 hours because it is just a combination of the previous lessons and projects with some thinking/analysis tasks.
